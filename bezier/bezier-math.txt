Bezier formula:

P (s) = (1 s)3 y0 + 3s(1 s)2 y1=3 + 3s2 (1 s)y2=3 + s3 y1

P  (s) = (1 - s)^3 P0  +  3s (1 - s)^2 P1  +  3s^2 (1 - s) P2  +  s^3 P3

1st derivative

P' (s) = -3 (1 - s)^2 P0  +  3(3s^2 - 4s +1) p1  + 3s (2 - 3s) P2  +  3s^2 P3

---Using the first derivative continuity condition:
--- 
--- B'[i-1](1) = B'[i](0)
--- 
and p3[i-1] = p0[i]
(let i-1 = j)
--- we get:

-3 P2 [j] + 3 P0 [i]  == -3 P0 [i] + 3 P1 [i] 

6 P0 [i] = 3 P1 [i] + 3 P2 [i - 1]
